**Gradient descent** is fundamental method in training a deep learning network. It aims to minimize the loss function $\mathcal{L}$ by updating model parameters in the direction that reduces the loss. By using only batch of the data we can compute the direction of the steepest descent. However, for large networks or more complicated challenges, this algorithm may not be successful! Let's find out why this happens and how we can fix this.

Check the code from the previous post [Solving Non-Linear Patterns with Deep Neural Networks](./deep_learning_network.md#deep-neural-network) and try experimenting with the learning rate for the `optimizer`. For example, setting `lr=0.01` can cause the optimizer to bounce around local minima. Even with `lr=0.001`, this problem can occur sometimes. When the optimizer moves too far in steep areas of the loss surface, the updates bounce back and forth, making the training oscillate and become unstable.

In this chapter, I use the training loop code many times. Let's build a unified training loop:

```python
def train_model(
    model: Module,
    loss_f: Module,
    optimizer,
    n_epochs: int = 500
):
    for epoch in range(n_epochs):
        # Forward
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_f(y_pred, y_target)

        model.zero_grad() 

        # Backward
        grad = loss_f.backward(y_pred, y_target)
        model.backward(grad)

        optimizer.step(model)

        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")

```

**Example:**

```python
# Model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Linear(x.shape[1], 128, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(128, 64, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(64, 1, init_method="xavier"),
    Sigmoid()
])

bce = BCELoss()
optimizer = SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)

# Training: SGD Epic Fail!
train_model(model, bce, optimizer, n_epochs=100)

```

**Output:**

```
# Bouncing

### SGD and Momentum, again!

[In my previous post](./linear_layer_and_sgd.md#stochastic-gradient-descent-sgd), I used separate terms for the momentum and gradient directions inside `SGD` for demonstration purposes. This is not the standard way of applying momentum, and it doesn't seem quite right. I used this for experimentation â€” you can amplify the direction for the velocity and the current gradient step separately.

$$v_{t+1} = \mu \cdot v_{t} - \alpha \nabla f(x_t)$$

The update rule for our position becomes:

$$x_{t+1} = x_t + v_{t+1}$$

And the implementation is here:

```python
# Update with momentum
self.velocity[param_id] = self.momentum * self.velocity[param_id] - self.lr * grad

# Update parameters
param.data += self.velocity[param_id]
```

Now let's use the correct, standard form where $\mu$ controls the influence of previous gradients, and $1 - \mu$ scales the current gradient like this:

$$v_{t+1} = \mu \cdot v_{t} + (1 - \mu) \nabla f(x_t)$$

The update rule for our position, where $\alpha$ is the step size, is:

$$x_{t+1} = x_t - \alpha \cdot v_{t+1}$$

In the correct implementation, we use **both** terms in the **negative direction.**

**Implementation:**

```python
class SGD:
    def __init__(
        self,
        lr: float = 0.01,
        momentum: float = 0.9,
    ):
        self.lr = lr
        self.momentum = momentum
        self.velocity = {}

    def step(self, module: Module):
        for param in module.parameters():
            param_id = param.name

            # Init velocity if not exists
            if param_id not in self.velocity:
                self.velocity[param_id] = np.zeros_like(param.data)

            grad = param.grad.copy()

            # Update momentum
            self.velocity[param_id] = (
                self.momentum * self.velocity[param_id] +
                (1 - self.momentum) * grad
            )

            # Update parameters in the *negative* direction!
            param.data -= self.lr * self.velocity[param_id]

```

Let's re-run our training loop with the same parameters:

```python
# Recreate Model, BCE, optimizer
model = Sequential([
    Linear(x.shape[1], 128, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(128, 64, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(64, 1, init_method="xavier"),
    Sigmoid()
])

bce = BCELoss()
optimizer = SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)

train_model(model, bce, optimizer)

```

**Output:**

```
Epoch 0, Loss: 0.7023
Epoch 1, Loss: 0.6343
Epoch 2, Loss: 0.6479
Epoch 3, Loss: 0.6560
Epoch 4, Loss: 0.6377
Epoch 5, Loss: 0.6282
Epoch 6, Loss: 0.6342
Epoch 7, Loss: 0.6373
Epoch 8, Loss: 0.6352
Epoch 9, Loss: 0.6288
# ...
Epoch 497, Loss: 0.0027
Epoch 498, Loss: 0.0027
Epoch 499, Loss: 0.0027
```

Stable movement towards the global minimum! The `SGD` optimization algorithm with vanilla `Momentum` now works stably!


## Gradient Clipping

The *spiral pattern* is highly non-linear which makes `SGD` struggles. **Momentum helps speed up convergence in consistent gradient directions**, but it can amplifies the problem. Momentum accumulates large, changing gradients, and **the velocity term becomes too large. Large gradient updates cause oscillations**.

In `SGD`, weights are updated with $\mu = 0.9$ (the momentum term), can which causes **large accumulated gradients**. **Momentum can lead to gradient explosion** because it accumulates *past gradients* and amplifies them by multiplying with the $\mu$ term:

The velocity term: $v_{t+1} = \mu \cdot v_{t} + (1 - \mu) \nabla f(x_t)$ and the update rule: $x_{t+1} = x_t - \alpha \cdot v_{t+1}$

Let's use the $\alpha=0.1$ and the same $\mu=0.9$:

$$x_{t+1} = x_t - 0.1 \cdot (0.9 \cdot v_t - 0.1 \cdot \nabla f(x_t))$$

If gradients ($\nabla f(x_t)$) are **large** (which is common in deep neural networks), the velocity term can build up, leading to **exploding updates**. This causes **SGD to fail to adapt**, bouncing around **sharp ridges** in the loss landscape instead of converging smoothly.

Let's run the training loop with the $\alpha=0.1$:

```python
# Recreate Model, BCE, optimizer
model = Sequential([
    Linear(x.shape[1], 128, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(128, 64, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(64, 1, init_method="xavier"),
    Sigmoid()
])
bce = BCELoss()
# lr=0.1
optimizer = SGD(lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)

train_model(model, bce, optimizer)

```

**Output:**

```
Epoch 0, Loss: 0.6846
Epoch 1, Loss: 2.3613
Epoch 2, Loss: 4.6792
Epoch 3, Loss: 2.0382

You might proudly tell me, "The learning rate is simply too high! Reduce the learning rate, and the result will stabilize." But I know a better way to fix this - one that works even with `lr=0.1`!

To fix the exploding gradient problem, I use **gradient clipping**. It limits the size of the gradients to a min/max range:

$$\nabla \mathcal{L} \leftarrow \text{clip}(\nabla \mathcal{L}, -\text{clip_value}, \text{clip_value})$$

This ensures that the gradients won't explode during backpropagation. Also, let's use the standard form where $\mu$ controls the influence of previous gradients and $1 - \mu$ scales the current gradient

**Implementation:**

```python
class SGD:
    def __init__(
        self,
        lr: float = 0.01,
        momentum: float = 0.9,
        clip_value: float = 1.0
    ):
        r"""
        Initializes the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer.

        Args:
            lr (float): Learning rate for updating the model's parameters.
            momentum (float): Momentum for accelerating gradient descent.
            clip_value (float): Value to clip gradients to avoid exploding gradients.
        """

        self.lr = lr
        self.momentum = momentum
        # Clipping value to avoid exploding gradients
        self.clip_value = clip_value
        # Store momentum for each parameter
        self.velocity = {}

    def step(self, module: Module):
        r"""
        Performs a single update step on the module parameters using the gradients.

        Args:
            module (Module): The module (e.g., layer) whose parameters are being updated.
        """

        for param in module.parameters():
            param_id = param.name

            # Initialize velocity if not exists
            if param_id not in self.velocity:
                self.velocity[param_id] = np.zeros_like(param.data)

            # Make a copy to avoid modifying original
            grad = param.grad.copy()  

            # Gradient clipping!
            if self.clip_value is not None:
                np.clip(grad, -self.clip_value, self.clip_value, out=grad)

            # Update momentum
            self.velocity[param_id] = (
                self.momentum * self.velocity[param_id] +
                (1 - self.momentum) * grad
            )

            # Update parameters in the *negative* direction!
            param.data -= self.lr * self.velocity[param_id]

```

This simple fix:

```python
if self.clip_value is not None:
  np.clip(grad, -self.clip_value, self.clip_value, out=grad)

```

Makes the training much more stable! Let's build the training loop and try to solve the spiral dataset.

```python
# Model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Linear(x.shape[1], 128, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(128, 64, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(64, 1, init_method="xavier"),
    Sigmoid()
])
bce = BCELoss()

# Use lr=0.1 for stable convergence!
optimizer = SGD(lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)

# 200 epochs are enoght!
train_model(model, bce, optimizer, n_epoch=200)

```

**Output:**

```
Epoch 0, Loss: 0.6648
Epoch 1, Loss: 0.6432
Epoch 2, Loss: 0.6413
Epoch 3, Loss: 0.6532
Epoch 4, Loss: 0.6473
Epoch 5, Loss: 0.6478
...
Epoch 196, Loss: 0.0234
Epoch 197, Loss: 0.0205
Epoch 198, Loss: 0.0223
Epoch 199, Loss: 0.0195
```


**Stable movement towards the solution!** We prevent the *exploding gradient* problem with gradient clipping!

Also, we **reduced the training epochs by more than half from `500` to `200`**, and got approximatelly the same result!


## Meet Fashion-MNIST!

Synthetic data is great for debugging and testing, but let's put our framework to the test with **Fashion-MNIST**! You can check my post [Dive into Learning from Data - MNIST Video Adventure](./dive_into_learning_from_data.md) to understand the original `MNIST` challenge. `Fashion-MNIST` is a similar challenge - but this time, we're classifying clothing items instead of handwritten digits.

**Fashion-MNIST** is a dataset created by *Zalando Research* as a drop-in replacement for `MNIST`. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images (28Ã—28 pixels) categorized into **10 different classes of clothing**, such as shirts, sneakers, and coats. **Your mission? Train a model to classify these fashion items correctly!**

Unlike `MNIST`, where a simple *Feed-Forward Neural Network* might achieve near-perfect accuracy, `Fashion-MNIST` is a bit more challenging due to the complexity of clothing patterns. But that won't stop us from trying! Let's download the dataset and plot some sample images.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml

# Fetch the Fashion MNIST dataset from OpenML
fashion_mnist = fetch_openml('Fashion-MNIST', version=1, as_frame=False)

# Separate the features (images) and labels
X, y = fashion_mnist['data'], fashion_mnist['target']

# Convert labels to integers (since OpenML may return them as strings)
y = y.astype(int)


# Define label names for Fashion MNIST classes
label_names = [
    "T-shirt/top", "Trouser", "Pullover", "Dress", "Coat",
    "Sandal", "Shirt", "Sneaker", "Bag", "Ankle boot"
]

# Plot some sample images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 5, figsize=(10, 6))
axes = axes.ravel()

for i in range(15):
    img = X[i].reshape(28, 28)  # Reshape the 1D array into a 28x28 image
    axes[i].imshow(img, cmap='gray')  # Display in grayscale
    axes[i].set_title(label_names[y[i]])  # Set label as title
    axes[i].axis('off')  # Hide axis

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

**Output:**

![Fashion-MNIST Dataset](../assets/sgd_gradient_cliping/fasion_mnist.png){ align=center }
/// caption

We need to prepare the data for training, so let's split the dataset into training and testing sets. This helps us train our model on one part of the data and test it on another. The main goal of training is to create a **generalized solution** that works on new, unseen data. To measure performance on unseen data, we set aside a portion of the dataset that won't be used during training. Instead, we use it **after training** to evaluate the model's accuracy.


```python
# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Convert labels to integers
y_train, y_test = y_train.astype(int), y_test.astype(int)

```

Let's also convert the labels to one-hot format. **One-hot labels are used because they make training more stable and efficient.** They allow neural networks to treat each class independently, preventing unintended relationships between class indices. This is especially useful for classification tasks with *softmax activation*, ensuring proper probability distribution and better gradient flow.

```python
# Convert labels to one-hot encoding
num_classes = 10
y_train_one_hot = np.eye(num_classes)[y_train]
y_test_one_hot = np.eye(num_classes)[y_test]
```

??? note "`np.eye` and one-hot encoding"
    We use `np.eye(num_classes)`, which creates an **identity matrix** of size `num_classes Ã— num_classes`.

    ```python
    np.eye(4)
    ```

    **Output:**

    ```plaintext
    [[1. 0. 0. 0.]
    [0. 1. 0. 0.]
    [0. 0. 1. 0.]
    [0. 0. 0. 1.]]
    ```

    Indexing with`y_train = [2, 0, 3, 1]` (`np.eye(num_classes)[y_train]`)
    ```python
    np.eye(4)[np.array([2, 0, 3, 1])]
    ```
    This selects the 2nd, 0th, 3rd, and 1st rows from the identity matrix.

    **Final One-Hot Encoded Output:**

    ```plaintext
    [[0. 0. 1. 0.]  # Class 2
    [1. 0. 0. 0.]  # Class 0
    [0. 0. 0. 1.]  # Class 3
    [0. 1. 0. 0.]] # Class 1
    ```

    `np.eye(num_classes)` gives a **lookup table** where each row is a one-hot vector, indexing with `y_train` **selects the correct rows** for the given labels. It's a **fast and memory-efficient** way to convert class indices to one-hot encoding.


For data preprocessing let's use the `MinMaxScaler`. In short - `MinMaxScaler` scales features to a fixed range, usually [0, 1], improving model performance and stability.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Rescale
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

```

You can check my post [Dive into Learning from Data - MNIST Video Adventure](./dive_into_learning_from_data.md), where we cracked the `MNIST` challenge and analyzed the image data.


## CrossEntropyLoss and Softmax

In this problem, we have **10 different classes** of clothing: `["T-shirt/top", "Trouser", "Pullover", "Dress", "Coat", "Sandal", "Shirt", "Sneaker", "Bag", "Ankle boot"]`  

Since we are dealing with multiple classes instead of just two, we need to **scale up** the entropy from `BinaryEntropyLoss` to `CrossEntropyLoss`. And the `Sigmoid` function is not the best choice for this task. `Sigmoid` outputs probabilities for each class independently, which is not good for multi-class classification. Instead, we need to assign probabilities across multiple classes, ensuring they **sum to 1**. A much better approach is to use the `Softmax` function, which converts raw model outputs (logits) into a probability distribution over all classes. This allows our model to make more accurate predictions by selecting the class with the highest probability.

In **multiclass classification**, the combination of **Softmax + Cross-Entropy Loss** has a unique property that simplifies the backward pass.

**The Softmax function** is defined as: $S_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}$ and its derivative forms a **Jacobian matrix**:

$$\frac{\partial S_i}{\partial z_j} =
\begin{cases}
S_i (1 - S_i) & \text{if } i = j \\
- S_i S_j & \text{if } i \neq j
\end{cases}$$

This **Jacobian matrix** is $N \times N$ (where $N$ is the number of classes), which makes direct backpropagation inefficient.

But, the Cross-Entropy Loss $L = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(S_i)$, and its gradient **after softmax** is simply:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial z} = S - y$$

The Softmax Jacobian **cancels out** with the Cross-Entropy derivative, so we **avoid computing the full Jacobian**. Instead, Softmax **directly passes** the gradient from Cross-Entropy, making backpropagation **simpler and more efficient**!

??? note "Why does the derivative of Cross-Entropy take the form $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i} = S_i - y_i$?"

    The Cross-Entropy Loss function is $L = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(S_i)$, where $y_i$ is the one-hot encoded true label ($y_i = 1$ for the correct class, 0 otherwise). $S_i$ is the softmax output (predicted probability for class $i$).

    Now, let's compute the derivative of $L$ with respect to $S_i$:

    $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial S_i} = -\frac{y_i}{S_i}$$

    However, the goal is to compute the gradient with respect to $z_i$ (the input logits), not $S_i$. This is where the `Softmax` derivative comes in. Softmax is defined as:

    $$S_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}$$


    The derivative of $S_i$ with respect to $z_j$ gives a **Jacobian matrix**:

    $$
    \frac{\partial S_i}{\partial z_j} =
    \begin{cases}
    S_i (1 - S_i) & \text{if } i = j \quad \text{(diagonal terms)}\\
    - S_i S_j & \text{if } i \neq j \quad \text{(off-diagonal terms)}
    \end{cases}
    $$

    This means that if we want to find how the loss $L$ changes with respect to $z_i$, we need to apply the **chain rule**:

    $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i} = \sum_{j} \frac{\partial L}{\partial S_j} \frac{\partial S_j}{\partial z_i}$$

    Substituting:

    $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial S_j} = -\frac{y_j}{S_j}$$

    and

    $$
    \frac{\partial S_j}{\partial z_i} =
    \begin{cases}
    S_j (1 - S_j) & \text{if } i = j \\
    - S_j S_i & \text{if } i \neq j
    \end{cases}
    $$

    Let's expand:

    $$
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i} = \sum_{j} -\frac{y_j}{S_j} \cdot \frac{\partial S_j}{\partial z_i}
    $$

    Breaking it into cases:

    1. **Diagonal term ($i = j$)**:

    $$
    -\frac{y_i}{S_i} \cdot S_i (1 - S_i) = - y_i (1 - S_i)
    $$

    2. **Off-diagonal terms ($i \neq j$)**:

    $$
    -\frac{y_j}{S_j} \cdot (- S_j S_i) = y_j S_i
    $$

    Summing over all $j$, we get:

    $$
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i} = - y_i (1 - S_i) + \sum_{j \neq i} y_j S_i
    $$

    Since $y$ is a one-hot vector, only one $y_j = 1$, and all others are 0, meaning:

    $$
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i} = S_i - y_i
    $$

    **Intuition Behind Cancellation**

    Instead of explicitly computing the full Softmax Jacobian, the multiplication of the Cross-Entropy derivative and the Softmax Jacobian **simplifies directly to $S - y$**.

    - This happens because the off-diagonal terms in the Jacobian sum *cancel out in the chain rule application.*
    - The result is **a simple gradient computation** without the need for the full Jacobian matrix.

    This is why, in backpropagation, the Softmax layer doesn't need to explicitly compute its Jacobian. Instead, we can directly use:

    $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial z} = S - y$$

    to efficiently update the parameters in neural network training.


**CrossEntropyLoss Implementation**

```python
class CrossEntropyLoss(Module):
    def forward(self, pred: np.ndarray, target: np.ndarray, epsilon: float = 1e-7) -> float:
        r"""
        Compute the Cross-Entropy loss for multiclass classification.

        Args:
            pred (np.ndarray): The predicted class probabilities from the model (output of softmax).
            target (np.ndarray): The one-hot encoded true target values.
            epsilon (float): A small value to avoid log(0) for numerical stability.

        Returns:
            float: The computed Cross-Entropy loss. Scalar for multiclass classification.
        """
        # Clip predictions to avoid log(0)
        pred = np.clip(pred, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)
        
        # Compute cross-entropy loss for each example
        loss = -np.sum(target * np.log(pred), axis=1)  # sum over classes for each example

        # Return the mean loss over the batch
        return np.mean(loss)
    
    def backward(self, pred: np.ndarray, target: np.ndarray, epsilon: float = 1e-7) -> np.ndarray:
        r"""
        Compute the gradient of the Cross-Entropy loss with respect to the predicted values.

            target (np.ndarray): The one-hot encoded true target values.
            epsilon (float): A small value to avoid division by zero for numerical stability.

        Returns:
            np.ndarray: The gradient of the loss with respect to the predictions.
        """

        # Clip predictions to avoid division by zero
        pred = np.clip(pred, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)
        
        # Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to predictions
        grad = pred - target  # gradient of cross-entropy w.r.t. predictions

        return grad

```

Now, let's see how this is efficiently handled in the **backward pass of Softmax**. The naive approach would be to compute the full **Softmax Jacobian matrix**, which has $N \times N$ elements (where $N$ is the number of classes). However, explicitly storing and multiplying by this matrix is computationally expensive. Instead, we take a **more efficient approach using vectorized computation**.

In the backward pass, we receive $d_{\text{out}} = S - y$, which is the **gradient of Cross-Entropy Loss with respect to Softmax outputs**. The goal is to compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z}$, the gradient of the loss with respect to logits.

The key observation is that for each example in the batch, the gradient of `Softmax` with respect to logits can be expressed as:

$$\frac{\partial S_i}{\partial z_j} d_{\text{out}_j}$$

Summing over all $j$, we get:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i} = S_i \left( d_{\text{out}_i} - \sum_j d_{\text{out}_j} S_j \right)$$

where $d_{\text{out}} = S - y$ is the gradient from Cross-Entropy and the term $\sum_j d_{\text{out}_j} S_j$ efficiently accounts for the interaction between all class probabilities.

Finally the **Softmax.backward()** function:

```python
def backward(self, d_out: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    return self.output * (d_out - np.sum(d_out * self.output, axis=1, keepdims=True))
```

Instead of explicitly constructing the Jacobian, we directly compute the **Jacobian-vector product**, which is all we need for backpropagation. This avoids unnecessary computations, making the `Softmax` backward pass **efficient and numerically stable**.


**Softmax Implementation**

```python
class Softmax(Module):
    """Softmax function and its derivative for backpropagation."""

    def forward(self, x: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Compute the Softmax of the input.
        Args:
            x (np.ndarray): Input array of shape (batch_size, n_classes).
        Returns:
            np.ndarray: Softmax probabilities.
        """
        
        # Subtract max for numerical stability
        exp_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x, axis=1, keepdims=True))
        self.output = exp_x / np.sum(exp_x, axis=1, keepdims=True)
        return self.output

    def backward(self, d_out: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the input of the softmax.
        Args:
            d_out (np.ndarray): Gradient of the loss with respect to the softmax output.
                                Shape: (batch_size, n_classes).
        Returns:
            np.ndarray: Gradient of the loss with respect to the input of the softmax.
                        Shape: (batch_size, n_classes).
        """

        # Compute batch-wise Jacobian-vector product without explicit Jacobian computation
        return self.output * (d_out - np.sum(d_out * self.output, axis=1, keepdims=True))
```

The combination of **Softmax + Cross-Entropy Loss** simplifies backpropagation significantly. Instead of computing the full Jacobian, the Softmax layer **directly propagates the gradient**. This is why deep learning frameworks implement **Softmax and Cross-Entropy together**, optimizing for both performance and numerical stability!


## `SGD` vs `Fashion-MNIST`

Let's prepare the model, loss function and use the `SGD` optimizer.

```python
input_dims = 784

model = Sequential([
    Linear(input_dims, 784, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(784, 256, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(256, 128, init_method="he_leaky"),
    LeakyReLU(alpha=0.01),
    Linear(128, 10, init_method="xavier"),  # 10 output logits for Fashion-MNIST
    Softmax()
])

bce = CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)

```

Now, let's build and run our training loop for `Fashion-MNIST`:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score


# Hyperparameters
epochs = 20
batch_size = 128


# Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Shuffle training data - can help prevent overfitting!
    # Stochastic batch of data for the training process!
    indices = np.random.permutation(X_train.shape[0])
    X_train_shuffled, y_train_shuffled = X_train[indices], y_train_one_hot[indices]

    total_loss = 0
    num_batches = X_train.shape[0] // batch_size

    for i in range(0, X_train.shape[0], batch_size):
        # Use a stochastic batch of data for training
        X_batch = X_train_shuffled[i:i+batch_size]
        y_batch = y_train_shuffled[i:i+batch_size]

        #############
        # Core steps!
        #############

        # Forward pass
        preds = model(X_batch)
        loss = bce(preds, y_batch)

        # Zero grad before the backward pass!
        model.zero_grad()

        # Backward pass
        d_loss = bce.backward(preds, y_batch)
        model.backward(d_loss)

        # Update weights
        optimizer.step(model)

        total_loss += loss

    # Compute average loss
    avg_loss = total_loss / num_batches
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Loss: {avg_loss:.4f}")


# Evaluation
y_pred = model(X_test)
y_pred_labels = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_labels)

print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

```


I shuffled the training data, which can help prevent overfitting because the training algorithm might make sense of the sequence of batches and start to adjust the weights in the direction of the training batches. Remember, we use a **stochastic batch of data for the training process** and compute the gradient direction of this mini-batch of data.


**Output:**

```
Epoch 1/20, Loss: 0.5885
Epoch 2/20, Loss: 0.4156
Epoch 3/20, Loss: 0.3807
Epoch 4/20, Loss: 0.3570
Epoch 5/20, Loss: 0.3370
Epoch 6/20, Loss: 0.3236
Epoch 7/20, Loss: 0.3089
Epoch 8/20, Loss: 0.3052
Epoch 9/20, Loss: 0.2970
Epoch 10/20, Loss: 0.2837
Epoch 11/20, Loss: 0.2757
Epoch 12/20, Loss: 0.2712
Epoch 13/20, Loss: 0.2636
Epoch 14/20, Loss: 0.2608
Epoch 15/20, Loss: 0.2513
Epoch 16/20, Loss: 0.2448
Epoch 17/20, Loss: 0.2438
Epoch 18/20, Loss: 0.2357
Epoch 19/20, Loss: 0.2325
Epoch 20/20, Loss: 0.2311
Test Accuracy: 89.94%
```

Also we can check the extended metrics:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Calculate precision, recall, and F1 scores per class
precision_per_class = precision_score(y_test, y_pred_labels, average=None)
recall_per_class = recall_score(y_test, y_pred_labels, average=None)
f1_per_class = f1_score(y_test, y_pred_labels, average=None)

# Create a DataFrame to store the metrics per class
metrics_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Class': range(len(precision_per_class)),
    'Precision': precision_per_class,
    'Recall': recall_per_class,
    'F1-Score': f1_per_class
})

# Display the table
print(metrics_df)
```

**Output:**

```
   Class  Precision    Recall  F1-Score
0      0   0.830812  0.866571  0.848315
1      1   0.991254  0.970043  0.980534
2      2   0.870843  0.800284  0.834074
3      3   0.877632  0.920635  0.898619
4      4   0.791472  0.875461  0.831351
5      5   0.973629  0.968254  0.970934
6      6   0.759445  0.700071  0.728550
7      7   0.939844  0.977189  0.958153
8      8   0.984733  0.961252  0.972851
9      9   0.978556  0.954672  0.966467
```

Not bad for `SGD`! We can use `SGD` with `momentum` and `gradient clipping` as an optimization baseline. From here, we can aim to surpass this baseline by exploring more *advanced optimization techniques*!
